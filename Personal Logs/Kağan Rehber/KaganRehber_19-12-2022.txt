This week i was handling getting the news and turning them into HTML file. I established the connection between the news site, parsed the HTML page info and got the essential information for news as JSON files. Then i created article objects with the info i got from JSON objects then used the NewsArticle objects to create an HTML page. Had to learn how to write a page in HTML for this. Eventually, News and NewsArticle classes are done, currently helping with the implementation of encryption methods.
