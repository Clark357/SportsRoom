ALPER DURMUŞ
+ This week, I did not implement code but I did the necessary research for
the encryotion algortihm. I will write the code for encryption and decryption next week.
As we decided as a group couple of weeks ago, We create similar encryption algorithm similar to AES
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard (The wiki page of the algorithm)
This algorithm uses a secret key to encrypt the data and the same secret key is used for decrypting it.
But for security reasons we will not be able to send the secret key by networks. As a result we decided to write a secret key creator
which is inspired from Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange (the Wiki page for the key exchange)
Since we needed a safe way to create secret keys, we will implement the EncryptionInitiator Class in order to create secret keys safely.
And as I said this will be inspired from Hellman Key Exchange.
I spacifially researched and learned the mathematics of this stuff, because as it is indicated in the Detailed Design Report I & Mehmet Can
Bıyık will be implementing this part of the program.

+ Also I created and pushed the necessary folders and placeholder files for logging our personal contributions to the SportsRoom Project.
